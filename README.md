# mini-python-projects
A collection of all the projects that I have worked during my period of learning to code in Python. 

1. Hacker Statistics - Random Walk:
   The first project is a hacker statistics method where I try to generate a random walk / pattern and try to find the probability of an occurance during the random walk.
2. Investigating Netflix Movies:
   The second project takes a csv data and performs data manipulation to extract required information from the dataset.
