# mini-python-projects
A collection of all the projects that I have worked during my period of learning to code in Python. 

1. Hacker Statistics - Random Walk:
   The first project is a hacker statistics method where I try to generate a random walk / pattern and try to find the probability of an occurance during the random walk.
2. Investigating Netflix Movies:
   The second project takes a csv data and performs data manipulation to extract required information from the dataset.
3. Extracting Insights from Twitter:
   The third project takes a real life dataset for twitter and performs the simplest data analysis by creating a dictionary using the for loop. 
4. Treasure Map;
   This project focuses on indexing inside lists. A map is provided, and the program should be able to mark an 'X' in the user-defined position. Although there are many ways to handle this, this particular code 
   file shows it using 2 data variables - lists, numpy arrays.
5. Generalising Insights Extraction from Twitter Data:
   This file generalises the program from the 3rd project and generalises it so that it can run on all columns as defined (and multiple columns together if needed).
